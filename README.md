### NOrthwind Database for MySQL8


Northwind database is one of the most used database to learn and teach [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/). Unfortunately there's no current version of the script that can work with the recent version of MySQL. This became a stumbling block to learn SQL for newbies. To solve the issue we have just curated the original script with an eye on [MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/). Based on the current version and best to our knowledge we have modified the data for study purpose.

**Note** ⚠️:<br>
    You may see some warning with `FLOAT` and `INT` data types, but that won't result an error. Still if you find any issue, please raise an issue. 
    
    This project is just for study and practice purpose.
